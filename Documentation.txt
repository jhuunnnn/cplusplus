C++ is a statically-typed language, meaning that the type of a variable is determined during compilation


First HelloWord.c++ file struture:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}


" #include <iostream> "
The first line of the program #include <iostream> is a preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to include the header file iostream. Header files provide function and class declarations that we can use in our C++ programs.


preprocessor directive - an instruction that tells the computer to prepare something before running the program.

" main() Function " 
the main() function serves as the entry point of your program. The operating system runs your program by calling this main() function.

Output to the Console
std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";

"std"
This is the namespace where C++ standard library entities (classes and functions) reside. It stands for "standard"

A namespace is like a name label that keeps things separate so they don’t get mixed up. A container that keeps names separate so they don’t clash.


like this >>>>
namespace SchoolA {
    int student = 30;
}

namespace SchoolB {
    int student = 50;
}

cout << SchoolA::student;
cout << SchoolB::student;

:: means “Go inside this namespace.”
